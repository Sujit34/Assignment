When we use lazy loading inside @Transactional annotation, the entity that is fetched from database is in managed state in persistant context which has the access to same entity manager.
So it can fetch data lazily using the same entity manager.  When we didn't use transaction we had to use eager loading because the Account entity will be detachd from persistant context
when it return to service layer. But in case of lazy loading with transaction entity is still managed in service layer.
